# README

## Requirements

1. `nodejs`
2. `npm`

## Contributions

1. before each git commit, run `npm run lint` from the `pentester-app` folder and attempt to cleanup any errors and warnings
   1. linting will change the code so you'll likely need to `git add . ../` again
2. git branching isn't necessary as this is a small project. working off main is just fine. use a resonably descriptive git commit message and all is well.

## Installing Nodejs via N

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/n
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/n
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/share
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/share

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tj/n/master/bin/n | bash -s lts
