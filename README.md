# README

## Requirements

1. `nodejs`
2. `npm`

## Contributions

1. before each git commit, run `npm run lint` from the `pentester-app` folder and attempt to cleanup any errors and warnings
   1. linting will change the code so you'll likely need to `git add . ../` again
2. git branching isn't necessary as this is a small project. working off main is just fine. use a resonably descriptive git commit message and all is well.

## Installing Nodejs via N

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/n
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/n
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/share
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/share

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tj/n/master/bin/n | bash -s lts

node --version
npm --version

```

## Getting Started

```bash
cd pentester-app
npm install

# to update the assets required for selecting an http file to download:
# the path is an absolute path to the given location of pentesting tools that might be useful to serve over http for downloading
#  on a target machine.
npm run dirtree -- '/home/kali/oscp/tools'


npm run dev

```

## Adding or Editing Commands.json

`src/assets/commands.json` contains the information for the commands available on the Tools page. To add or edit is mostly the same process, however a few things should be known up front.

1. The web app `New Command` ui does NOT write to the `commands.json` file. That must be done from a terminal (suggest using `./json.sh`).
2. The New Command ui has limited validation of input data. This will improve over time. Until then, consider what each value is intended for and read the relevant help section.
3. To save any changes you must add the new json element to the `commands.json` base array, or overwrite an existing element.
4. Manual editing of `commands.json` data is not suggested as the New Command ui works quite well. Be sure to test any edits before making a PR so that the entire app isn't broken due to poorly formatted json.

### Helpful Commands

Here are some helpful commands for various tasks relating to updating the json.

```bash
# consider installing jq for json processing, this is not a default on kali
sudo apt install jq

# source code base directory
cd pentester-app

# using the custom json.sh script, learn about it's options via help.
# NOTE: this script mostly uses the clipboard via the xclip utility.
#     this means that it flows nicely with the New Command tool by coping the new/updated json
#     and then running ./json.sh with the appropriate flag.
./json.sh -h

```
