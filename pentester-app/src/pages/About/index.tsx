      <Typography>
        Pentesting Tools current goal is to help a pentester create valid
        commands quickly, with the various options, through a simple gui
        interface (aka web app).
        <br />
        <br />
        New Commands are added via json to the /assets/commands.json file. The
        web app also has a gui for creating the necessary json via the New
        Command button in the header nav.

      <Typography variant="h5">Why is this useful?</Typography>

      <Typography>
        Often it can be difficult to remember every single flag or subtle
        specifics for a given command. This tool aims to help solve this
        problem. Essentially your notes and any command history can be used to
        add to this tool, while benefiting from the existing commands.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another big feature is the ability for a Command to have associated
        Download Files. These supplemental files can be very useful for custom
        tooling options.
